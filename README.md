# 2Chat
### Information
What is 2Chat? 2Chat is a text & voice replit chat application with a built electron app. You can chat with other replit users, or create a room with the "Join Room" or "Join Voice" button. Voice chat is currently only allowed with whitelisted users, as we cannot moderate Voice Chat.

### Forking/Cloning
#### Rules
You may fork this repl/clone this repository, but please do not use the name "2Chat" for your app. You can learn more of what you can and cannot in the LICENSE.

#### How-To
After you clone / fork this, please start by changing all instances of '2chat' to your own name. This can be done by editing the "name" in the `package.json`. You may change your own whitelisted users in the voice chat section. We will not help you directly.
